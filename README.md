RSS Feed Reader APP

1. What is a RSS Feed Reader ?
RSS (Rich Site Summary) is a format for delivering regularly changing web content. Many news-related sites, weblogs and other online publishers syndicate their content as an RSS Feed to whoever wants it. Feed Reader allows you to grad the RSS feeds from various sites and diplay them for you to read and use. 
Our application is a web-based feed reader. It grabs RSS Feed from Udacity Blog, CSS Tricks, HTML5 Rocks as well as Linear Digressions. It allows you to easily stay informed of the newest techniques in web development by retrieving the latest content from these sites. You save time by not needing to visit each site individually .
